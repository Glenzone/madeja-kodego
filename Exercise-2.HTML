        About Me
    </h2>
    <p>I am currently working as a product specialist. I am part of a company that specializes in wholesaling medical devices.</p>
    
    <p>We serve several hospitals from different provinces and local government units. I am really exited about my current work as I am able to discover many medical devices and equipment and meet several people in the medical field.</p>

    <p>I am interested in computers and I would like to take a step to further my knowledge in this technolgy hence, I decided to take this class. I am very passionate about how the web works and I would like to be a part of this field as well. I am hoping that someday my passion with life, science, and technology would be able to leave an impact in the healthcare industry.</p>
